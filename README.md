This is a simple python chatbot which uses json file to store the data. It uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to classify the user input and give the response.

This project is under development and soon will be supported to web with multi modal support.
